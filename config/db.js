// The db.js file in the config directory of your project plays a critical role in managing database connections to MongoDB using the Mongoose library. This setup ensures that all parts of your application can interact seamlessly with your database, allowing for robust data management and operations.

// **Detailed Explanation of db.js**

// **Importing Mongoose:**
// Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It simplifies interactions with the MongoDB database through schemas which define the structure of the data.

// ```javascript
// const mongoose = require('mongoose');
// ```

// **ConnectDB Function:**
// - **Purpose:** The `connectDB` function initializes a connection to the MongoDB database. It is defined as an asynchronous function to handle the asynchronous nature of network operations involved in establishing a database connection.
// - **Configuration:** It uses environment variables (process.env.MONGO_URI) to securely access the database URI, which includes credentials and connection details.
// - **Options:** 
//    - `useNewUrlParser`: Ensures the use of MongoDB’s new URL string parser.
//    - `useUnifiedTopology`: Utilizes MongoDB’s new connection management engine, which supports more stable connections.
// - **Execution:** 
//    - The function uses `mongoose.connect()` to establish a connection to MongoDB. If the connection is successful, it logs the connected database host for confirmation.
//    - If there is a connection error, it catches the error, logs it, and exits the process with a failure code (1).

// **Example of connectDB Function:**
// ```javascript
// async function connectDB() {
//     try {
//         const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
//             useNewUrlParser: true,
//             useUnifiedTopology: true
//         });
//         console.log(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`);
//     } catch (error) {
//         console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
//         process.exit(1);
//     }
// }
// ```

// **Exporting the connectDB Function:**
// The `connectDB` function is exported to be reusable in other parts of the application, typically at the start-up stage. This ensures that the database connection is established before any data operations occur.

// ```javascript
// module.exports = connectDB;
// ```

// **Benefits of Using Mongoose with MongoDB in Your Project:**
// - **Schema-based Solution:** Helps define models clearly and concisely.
// - **Data Validation:** Mongoose provides built-in validation which is crucial for maintaining data integrity.
// - **Query Building:** Simplifies query operations with powerful and flexible API.
// - **Middleware Hooks:** Allows you to run your code before or after certain events (e.g., saving a document).

// This configuration file is vital for maintaining effective data flow and integrity throughout your application, ensuring that all components can rely on a stable and consistent database connection.



// This line of code imports the Mongoose library, which allows you to interact with MongoDB databases in Node.js:
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// The connectDB function is defined as an async function, which means that it can use the await keyword to wait for asynchronous operations to complete:
const connectDB = async () => 
{
    try 
    {
        // MongoDB database URI:
        const uri = process.env.MONGO_URI

        // Trying to establish connection with MongoDB database by calling the "mongoose.connect()" function, passing in the connection string and an options object:
        const conn = await mongoose.connect(uri, {
            // The options object specifies that the new URL parser and unified topology should be used:
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true,
        });
        console.log(`MongoDB database connection established successfully: ${conn.connection.host}`);
    } catch (err) 
    {
        console.log(err);
        process.exit(1);
    }
};

// The connectDB function is exported so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application:
module.exports = connectDB;
