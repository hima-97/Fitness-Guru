// The CreateWorkout.js file in the Fitness Guru application defines a functional React component that serves as the interface for users to create new workouts. This component is designed to be straightforward, guiding users through the workout creation process with clear instructions and a consistent layout.

// **Imports**
// It imports:
// - **React:** Main library for building user interfaces.
// - **Container:** From 'react-bootstrap', used for layout and positioning of elements.
// - **getUser:** Utility function from '../utils/get-user', for fetching the current user's data from the server.
// - **Layout:** Component from '../components/Layout', which provides a consistent layout across the application.

// **CreateWorkout Component**
// A functional component that:
// - Utilizes the 'Layout' component to wrap the page content, ensuring consistent navigation and footer presentation across the application.
// - Renders within a 'Container' for proper alignment and spacing of the page content.
// - Displays a header with the text "This is the Create Workout page," which directly informs users of their location within the application and what they can do on this page.
// - **Simplicity and User Direction:**
//   - Offers clear, concise information that the user is on the "Create Workout" page, facilitating a user-friendly experience by minimizing confusion.
// - **Use of Layout for Consistency:**
//   - Ensures that the user experience is coherent with other parts of the application by using the 'Layout' component, which includes the standard navigation bar and footer.
// - **Integration with User Data:**
//   - Fetches and displays user data if necessary, using the 'getUser' function, which enhances the personalization of the user interface.

// **Return Statement:**
// - The component returns JSX that includes the 'Layout' wrapping the 'Container', which then contains a header element stating the purpose of the page.
// - This setup not only maintains visual consistency but also supports navigation continuity, making the application intuitive and accessible.

// **CSS Styling:**
// - Likely uses CSS for styling the Container and header elements, ensuring that the page is visually appealing and aligns with the application's design standards.

// **Key Features and Functionality**
// - **Simplicity and User Direction:** Clearly guides users through the workout creation process, enhancing usability.
// - **Use of Layout for Consistency:** Maintains a uniform look and functionality across pages.
// - **Integration with User Data:** Demonstrates practical application of fetching and utilizing user data, supporting personalized experiences.

// Importing the getUser utility function that retrieves the current user's data
import getUser from "../utils/get-user";

// Importing the Layout component, which typically includes the navigation bar, footer, and other common UI elements across the application
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

// Define the CreateWorkout component as a default export, making it available for import in other files
export default function CreateWorkout() {
    // Retrieve the current user's information using the getUser function and store it in the 'user' constant
    const user = getUser();

    // The component returns JSX elements to render on the page
    return (
        // The Layout component is used here to wrap the page content, ensuring consistent layout across the site
        // The 'user' object is passed to Layout to allow for dynamic display based on user information
        <Layout user={user}>
            // Container from react-bootstrap is used to provide consistent spacing and alignment
            <Container>
